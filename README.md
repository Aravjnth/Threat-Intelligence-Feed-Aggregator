Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator

## Overview

The Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator is a Python-based tool designed to aggregate and analyze threat intelligence data from multiple sources. This tool helps security analysts collect, process, and correlate threat data to identify and respond to potential security threats more effectively.

## Features

- Aggregate threat intelligence feeds from various sources.
- Normalize and correlate threat data.
- Support for multiple feed formats (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.).
- Generate detailed reports and alerts.
- Integrate with SIEM and other security tools.
- User-friendly command-line interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `pandas` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library (for parsing HTML/XML feeds)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Aravjnth/Threat-Intelligence-Feed-Aggregator.git
    cd threat-intelligence-feed-aggregator
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Configure the feeds in a configuration file (e.g., `feeds.yaml`):
    ```yaml
    feeds:
      - name: Feed1
        url: https://example.com/feed1.json
        type: json
      - name: Feed2
        url: https://example.com/feed2.xml
        type: xml
      - name: Feed3
        url: https://example.com/feed3.csv
        type: csv
    ```

2. Run the tool to aggregate and analyze threat intelligence data:
    ```bash
    python aggregator.py --config <config-file> --output <output-directory>
    ```

    Replace `<config-file>` and `<output-directory>` with the actual values.

### Example

Aggregate and analyze threat intelligence data using `feeds.yaml` and save the output to `./output` directory:

```bash
python aggregator.py --config feeds.yaml --output ./output
```

## Options

- `--config`: Path to the configuration file containing feed details.
- `--output`: Directory where the aggregated and analyzed data will be saved.
- `--log`: (Optional) Path to the log file.
